package plugin6

// plugin6 builds on types in package plugin to include support for provider
// protocol v6. The main gRPC functions, such as Serve, live wholly in the plugin package.

// When provider protocol v5 is deprecated, those functions will need to be
// moved here before removing the plugin pacakge.
